# ERIS-scripts
Helper scripts for NIX and SPIFFIER data reduction

### Installation

You can setup the scripts on your machine following the simple steps:

1. Download the repo into a folder on your computer. This folder should not be moved once the setup is done. We recommend a repository folder or a scripts folder on your home directory
2. move into the folder ./NIX and make the installation script executable by `chmod +x ./install`.
3. Run the `install` script and follow the prompts on the command line. Remember to add the script folder to your PATH variable.

Following the above steps, you should be able to run the scripts from anywhere on your computer.
